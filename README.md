# JavaFX & MySQL Customer Management Application

This is a simple JavaFX application that allows users to register and manage customer data in a local MySQL database. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, a MySQL database to store the data, and JDBC to connect and execute queries with the database.


### Requirement:

* Java (version 11 or higher) - Download and install from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).

* MySQL (version 8 or higher) - Download and install from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).


### Setup:

* Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
* Modify the `DataBaseConnection` class to include your MySQL database name, user, and password.
* Run the application. The database and customer table will be created automatically if they do not exist.
