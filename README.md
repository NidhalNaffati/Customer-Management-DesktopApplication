This is a simple JavaFX project aiming to do some local registration of some data from "CUSTOMERS" in our database.

#### In this app we used :

* MySQL as a DataBase
* JDBC to connect and execute our queries with the database. 
* Java for doing backend stuff and handle exceptions.


### Requirement:

    * install java in your machine using this link:
      https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html

    * Modify the DataBaseConnection Class (put your database name,user and the password).
